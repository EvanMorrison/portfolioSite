# Personal Portfolio Site

## [Visit site: evmorrison.com](https://evmorrison.com) 

## Description
A personal portfolio website built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),[Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/), and [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics). Transpiling, bundling, and build processing done with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Styling with Styled-Components
React has given rise to some new ways to approach css styling, and I absolutely love [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics). It's among the several more popular liabraries, along with Radium, Glamorous, etc. There are good reasons to like any of these, but for me Styled-Components, is really amazing.

## Details
The site is fairly clean and simple on a single page. There's no permanent navbar, but 
an expandable nav menu provides smooth scrolling to corresponding section 
of the website.

Sections:
* Hero Image Home and Title
* Contact Info and Resume
* About Me Summary 
* Sample Projects: a selection of projects with links to live deployments
 as well as to Github for further details and information.
