            <p style={paragraph}>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with a background in real estate law.</p>
            <p style={paragraph}>More than ten years ago my interest in coding led me to teach myself enough to code my first 'app', a tool for automating case handling in my real estate law practice. Ever since then I&rsquo;ve known coding was what I really wanted to do.</p>
            <p style={paragraph}>I currently specialize in the JavaScript MEAN stack, jQuery, React, Webpack and more and have a portfolio of work with various clients and Open Source contributions (check it out below!). I&rsquo;ve also completed over 600 hours of intensive training in Full Stack Web Development at <a className="about-vschool" href="http://vschool.io">V School</a> and continue to expand my skills with hundreds of more hours of work and training. I'm currently working on various professional projects for clients and love working on open source projects. </p>
