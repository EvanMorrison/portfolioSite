            <p style={paragraph}>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with a background in real estate law and applied math.</p>
            <p style={paragraph}>More than ten years ago my interest in coding led me to teach myself enough to code my first 'app', a tool for automating case handling in my real estate practice. Ever since then I&rsquo;ve known coding was what I really wanted to do.</p>
            <p style={paragraph}>I currently specialize in the JavaScript MEAN stack, jQuery, React, Webpack and more and have a portfolio of work with various clients and Open Source contributions (check it out below!). I am continually seeking to expand my skills and knowledge and tackle new challenges. I'm currently working on various professional projects for clients and love working on open source projects too.  </p>
