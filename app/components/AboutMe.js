Ever since then I&rsquo;ve known coding was what I really wanted to do.</p>
            <p style={paragraph}>I completed over 600 hours of intensive training in Full Stack Web Development at the excellent <a href="http://vschool.io">V School</a> web dev bootcamp. I'm currently working on various professional projects for clients, and continue to expand my skills with hudreds more hours of training and work on open source projects. </p>
            <p style={paragraph}>I am knowledgable in many of the most widely used languages, libraries, and frameworks of modern web development, from JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, to JQuery, AngularJS, React, Webpack, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.</p>
